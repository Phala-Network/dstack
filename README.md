# Dstack

Dstack is a **developer friendly** and **security first** SDK to simplify the deployment of arbitrary containerized apps into TEE.

Main features:

- 🔒 Deploy containerized apps securely in TEE in minutes
- 🛠️ Use familiar tools - just write a docker-compose.yaml
- 🔑 Safely manage secrets and sensitive data
- 📡 Expose services via built-in TLS termination

Dstack is community driven. Open sourced and built by [Kevin Wang](https://github.com/kvinwang) and many others from [Phala Network](https://github.com/Phala-Network), inspired by [Andrew Miller](https://github.com/amiller) (Flashbots & Teleport), and contributed by [Neithermind](https://github.com/neithermind) and [many others](#contributors).

> If you are looking to deploy a CVM in minutes, go to the docs to learn how to [sign-up for a Phala Cloud Account](https://docs.phala.network/phala-cloud/getting-started/sign-up-for-cloud-account) and [deploy your first CVM on Dstack]((https://docs.phala.network/phala-cloud/getting-started/start-from-cloud-ui)).

## Install dependencies

```bash
# for Ubuntu 24.04
sudo apt install -y build-essential chrpath diffstat lz4 wireguard-tools xorriso
# install rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Build and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/meta-dstack.git --recursive
cd meta-dstack/
source dev-setup

mkdir build
cd build
../build.sh
# This outputs the following message:
# Config file ../build-config.sh created, please edit it to configure the build

vim ./build-config.sh
```

Now edit the config file. The following configurations values must be changed properly according to your environment:

```bash
# The internal port for dstack-vmm to listen to requests from you
VMM_RPC_LISTEN_PORT=9080
# The start CID for dstack-vmm to allocate to CVMs
VMM_CID_POOL_START=20000

# The internal port for kms to listen to requests from CVMs
KMS_RPC_LISTEN_PORT=9043
# The internal port for dstack-gateway to listen to requests from CVMs
GATEWAY_RPC_LISTEN_PORT=9070

# WireGuard interface name for dstack-gateway
GATEWAY_WG_INTERFACE=dgw-kvin
# WireGuard listening port for dstack-gateway
GATEWAY_WG_LISTEN_PORT=9182
# WireGuard server IP for dstack-gateway
GATEWAY_WG_IP=10.0.3.1
# WireGuard client IP range
GATEWAY_WG_CLIENT_IP_RANGE=10.0.3.0/24
# The public port for dstack-gateway to listen to requests that would be forwarded to app in CVMs
GATEWAY_SERVE_PORT=9443

# The public domain name for dstack-gateway. Please set a wildacard DNS record (e.g. *.app.kvin.wang in this example)
# for this domain that points the IP address of your TDX host.
GATEWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=app.kvin.wang
# The path to the TLS certificate for dstack-gateway's public endpoint
GATEWAY_CERT=/etc/rproxy/certs/cert.pem
# The path to the TLS key for dstack-gateway's public endpoint
GATEWAY_KEY=/etc/rproxy/certs/key.pem
```

Run build.sh again to build the artifacts.

```bash
../build.sh

# If everything is okay, you should see the built artifacts in the `build` directory.
$ ls
certs  images  dstack-kms  kms.toml  run  dstack-vmm  vmm.toml  dstack-gateway  gateway.toml
```

Now you can open 3 terminals to start the components:

1. Run `./dstack-kms -c kms.toml`
2. Run `sudo ./dstack-gateway -c gateway.toml`
3. Run `./dstack-vmm -c vmm.toml`

## Deploy an App
Open the dstack-vmm webpage [http://localhost:9080](http://localhost:9080)(change the port according to your configuration) on your local machine to deploy a `docker-compose.yaml` file:

![vmm](./docs/assets/vmm.png)

After the container deployed, it should need some time to start the CVM and the containers. Time would be vary depending on your workload.

- Click the [Logs] button to see the logs of the CVM, you can see if the container is finished starting there.

- Once the container is running, you can click the [Dashboard] button to see some information of the container. And the logs of the containers can be seen in the [Dashboard] page.

    ![dstack-guest-agent](./docs/assets/guest-agent.png)

- You can open dstack-gateway's dashboard at [https://localhost:9070](https://localhost:9070) to see the CVM's wireguard ip address, as shown below:

![dstack-gateway](./docs/assets/gateway.png)

## Pass Secrets to Apps
When deploying a new App, you can pass private data via Encrypted Environment Variables. These variables can be referenced in the docker-compose.yaml file as shown below:

![secret](./docs/assets/secret.png)

The environment variables will be encrypted in the client-side and decrypted in the CVM before being passed to the containers.

## Access the App

Once the app is deployed and listening on an HTTP port, you can access the HTTP service via dstack-gateway's public domain. The ingress mapping rules are:

- `<id>[s].<base_domain>` maps to port `80` or `443` if with `s` in the CVM.
- `<id>-<port>[s].<base_domain>` maps to port `<port>` in the CVM.

For example, `3327603e03f5bd1f830812ca4a789277fc31f577-8080.app.kvin.wang` maps to port `8080` in the CVM.

Where the `<id>` can be either the app id or the instance id. If the app id is used, one of the instances will be selected by the load balancer.
If the `id-port` part ends with `s`, it means the TLS connection will be passthrough to the app rather than terminating at dstack-gateway.

You can also ssh into the CVM to inspect more information, if your deployment uses the image `dstack-x.x.x-dev`:

```bash
# The IP address of the CVM can be found in the dstack-gateway dashboard.
ssh root@10.0.3.2
```

## Getting TDX quote in docker container

To get a TDX quote within app containers:

1. Mount `/var/run/dstack.sock` to the target container in `docker-compose.yaml`

    ```yaml
    version: '3'
    services:
    nginx:
        image: nginx:latest
        volumes:
        - /var/run/dstack.sock:/var/run/dstack.sock
        ports:
        - "8080:80"
        restart: always
    ```

2. Execute the quote request command in the container.

    ```bash
    # The argument report_data accepts binary data encoding in hex string.
    # The actual report_data passing the to the underlying TDX driver is sha2_256(report_data).
    curl --unix-socket /var/run/dstack.sock http://localhost/GetQuote?report_data=0x1234deadbeef | jq .  
    ```

## Container logs

Container logs can be obtained from the CVM's `dashboard` page or by curl:

```bash
curl 'http://<appid>.app.kvin.wang:9090/logs/<container name>?since=0&until=0&follow=true&text=true&timestamps=true&bare=true'
```

Replace `<appid>` and `<container name>` with actual values. Available parameters:

- since=0: Starting Unix timestamp for log retrieval
- until=0: Ending Unix timestamp for log retrieval
- follow: Enables continuous log streaming
- text: Returns human-readable text instead of base64 encoding
- timestamps: Adds timestamps to each log line
- bare: Returns the raw log lines without json format

The response of the RPC looks like:
```
$ curl 'http://0.0.0.0:9190/logs/zk-provider-server?text&timestamps'
{"channel":"stdout","message":"2024-09-29T03:05:45.209507046Z Initializing Rust backend...\n"}
{"channel":"stdout","message":"2024-09-29T03:05:45.209543047Z Calling Rust function: init\n"}
{"channel":"stdout","message":"2024-09-29T03:05:45.209544957Z [2024-09-29T03:05:44Z INFO  rust_prover] Initializing...\n"}
{"channel":"stdout","message":"2024-09-29T03:05:45.209546381Z [2024-09-29T03:05:44Z INFO  rust_prover::groth16] Starting setup process\n"}
```

## Reverse proxy: TLS Passthrough

dstack-gateway listens for incoming TLS connections and forwards them to the appropriate app based on `SNI`. If the SNI is your custom domain, dstack-gateway queries the TXT DNS record `_dstack-app-address.<custom_domain>` to determine the forwarding destination.

For example, assuming I've deployed an app at `3327603e03f5bd1f830812ca4a789277fc31f577`, as shown below:

![appid](./docs/assets/appid.png)

Now, I want to use my custom domain `myapp.kvin.wang` to access the app. I need to set up two DNS records with my DNS provider (Cloudflare in my case):

1. `A` or `CNAME` record to point the domain to the tdx machine:

    ![app-dns-a](./docs/assets/app-dns-a.png)

2. `TXT` record to instruct the dstack-gateway to direct the request to the specified app:

    ![app-dns-txt](./docs/assets/app-dns-txt.png)

Where

`_dstack-app-address.myapp.kvin.wang` means configuring the app destination address of domain `myapp.kvin.wang`.

The TXT record value `3327603e03f5bd1f830812ca4a789277fc31f577:8043` means that requests sent to `myapp.kvin.wang` will be processed by app `3327603e03f5bd1f830812ca4a789277fc31f577` on port `8043`

Now we can go to [`https://myapp.kvin.wang`](https://myapp.kvin.wang) and the request will be handled by the service listening on `8043` in app `3327603e03f5bd1f830812ca4a789277fc31f577`.

## Upgrade an App

Got to the dstack-vmm webpage, click the [Upgrade] button, select or paste the compose file you want to upgrade to, and click the [Upgrade] button again.
The app id does not change after the upgrade. Stop and start the app to apply the upgrade.

## HTTPS Certificate Transparency

In the tutorial above, we used a TLS certificate with a private key external to the TEE. To establish trust, we need to generate and maintain the certificate's private key within the TEE and provide evidence that all TLS certificates for the domain were originate solely from dstack-gateway CVM.

By combining Certificate Transparency Logs and CAA DNS records, we can make best effort to minimize security risks. Here's our approach:

- Set CAA records to allow only the account created in dstack-gateway CVM to request Certificates.
- Launch a program to monitor Certificate Transparency Log and give alarm once any certificate issued to a pubkey that isn’t generated by dstack-gateway CVM.

### Configurations

To launch Certbot, you need to own a domain hosted on Cloudflare. Obtain an API token with DNS operation permissions from the Cloudflare dashboard. Configure it in the `build-config.sh`:

```bash
# The directory to store the auto obtained TLS certificate and key
GATEWAY_CERT=${CERBOT_WORKDIR}/live/cert.pem
GATEWAY_KEY=${CERBOT_WORKDIR}/live/key.pem

# for certbot
CF_ZONE_ID=cc0a40...
CF_API_TOKEN=g-DwMH...
# ACME_URL=https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
ACME_URL=https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
```

Then re-run the ../build.sh:

```bash
../build.sh
```

### Launch certbot

Then run the certbot in the `build/` and you will see the following log:
```text

```

Where the command did are:

- Registered to letsencrypt and got a new account `https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/acct/168601853`
- Auto set CAA records for the domain on cloudflare, you can open the CF dashboard to see the record:

    ![certbot-caa](./docs/assets/certbot-caa.png)

- Auto requested a new certificate from Let's Encrypt. Automatically renews the certificate to maintain its validity

### Launch dstack-gateway

Execute dstack-gateway with `sudo ./dstack-gateway -c gateway.toml`, then access the web portal to check the dstack-gateway CVM managed Let's Encrypt account. The account's private key remains securely sealed within the TEE.

![gateway-accountid](./docs/assets/gateway-accountid.png)

## Certificate transparency log monitor

To enhance security, we've limited TLS certificate issuance to dstack-gateway via CAA records. However, since these records can be modified through Cloudflare's domain management, we need to implement global CA certificate monitoring to maintain security oversight.

`ct_monitor` tracks Certificate Transparency logs via [https://crt.sh](https://crt.sh/?q=app.kvin.wang), comparing their public key with the ones got from dstack-gateway RPC. It immediately alerts when detecting unauthorized certificates not issued through dstack-gateway:

```text

```

# Troubleshooting

### Error from dstack-vmm: qemu-system-x86_64: -device vhost-vsock-pci,guest-cid=<id>: vhost-vsock: unable to set guest cid: Address already in use

`dstack-vmm` may throw this error when creating a new VM if the [Unix Socket CID](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/vsock.7.html) is occupied. To solve the problem, first, you should list the occupied CID:

```bash
ps aux | grep 'guest-cid='
```

Then choose a new range of the CID not conflicting with the CID in use. You can change `build/vmm.toml` file and restart `dstack-vmm`. This error should disappear. For example, you may find 33000-34000 free to use:

```toml
[cvm]
cid_start = 33000
cid_pool_size = 1000
```

When building the dstack from scratch, you should change the CID configs in `build-config.sh` instead, because `vmm.toml` file is generated by `build.sh`. Its content is derived from `build-config.sh`.

You may encounter this problem when upgrading from an older version of dstack, because CID was introduced in `build-config.sh` in later versions. In such case, please follow the docs to add the missing entries in `build-config.sh` and rebuild dstack.

### Error: Operation not permitted when building guest image

When running `../build.sh guest`, you might encounter this error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/meta-dstack/poky/bitbake/bin/bitbake-worker", line 278, in child
    bb.utils.disable_network(uid, gid)
  File "/meta-dstack/poky/bitbake/lib/bb/utils.py", line 1696, in disable_network
    with open("/proc/self/uid_map", "w") as f:
PermissionError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted
```

This error occurs because Ubuntu 23.10 and later versions restrict unprivileged user namespaces by default. To fix this, run:

```bash
sudo sysctl kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0
```

Then try building again. For more information about this restriction, see the [Ubuntu discourse post](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/spec-unprivileged-user-namespace-restrictions-via-apparmor-in-ubuntu-23-10/37626).
